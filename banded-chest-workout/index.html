<p>Feel free to mix and match any of the above exercises. But Id recommend instead splitting the exercises up into at least 2 days throughout the week using an upperlower split for example. Pull the band in to your chest and hold for a second shoulders back and shoulder blades together. Pause and then reverse the movement to return to the starting position. Although this movement is generally associated with leg workouts we added it to our banded back workout as it works the posterior chain and that was our focus of the day.</p>
