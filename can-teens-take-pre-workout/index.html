<p>Answered 1 year ago Author has 456 answers and 1975K answer views. ActiveKidMDs goal is to help teenage athletes reach full potential in sports school and life. Teens as young as 9th graders and onwards use creatine to help them with sufficient muscle power strength and stamina for enhanced performance. Doctors usually recommend it be used only by athletes over 18 years old. It can last for hours and when this is mixed with the typical teenage attitude which often lacks emotional control the combination can be difficult to deal with.</p>
