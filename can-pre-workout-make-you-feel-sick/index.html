<p>You have to wait for the affects of the caffeine to wear off. Just cycle off any preworkouts for atleast 2 weeks and then take it again. I have no-xplode 20 watermelon and it works well except that it makes me feel very nauseous during my workout. Fortunately you can minimize or eliminate exercise-induced nausea by adjusting a few elements of your routine. Or you might need to take a lower dosage to begin with to build up your tolerance.</p>
