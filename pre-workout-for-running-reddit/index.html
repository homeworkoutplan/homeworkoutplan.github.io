<p>Preworkout for running especially low mileage is essentially useless. Even then I dont worry about supplements or pre-workouts and just eat normally. Most of us recreational runners dont generally push ourselves hard enough for specialized nutrition to be immensely helpful. If you must take it take it after your run and before you lift. Running before lifting is counterproductive to your lifting goals.</p>
