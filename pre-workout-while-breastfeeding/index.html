<p>I hope this helps all you pregnant and breastfeeding mamas. I hope this helps all you pregnant and breastfeeding mamas. Anywho an overwhelming majority of my new followers want to know the same thing. These are some of the supplements I take while still nursing my 17 month old. It is a natural product but of course has stimulants no caffeine.</p>

<p>The only supps typically recommended are the same ones before and during pregnancy such as prenatal. One reason being the caffeine content exceeds the daily recommended amount. I was hearing all of the good things about Energize but was hesitant to order some because I was still breastfeeding my daughter and I was scared on how it would affect her. Ill write about how that happened in a later post. With its strong antioxidative properties studies have suggested that NAC may help reduce the chance of unexpected pregnancy loss which may be caused by oxidative stress.</p>
