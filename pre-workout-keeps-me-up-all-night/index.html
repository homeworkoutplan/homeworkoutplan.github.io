<p>Dspark is a perfect option and the stuff is only 59 at NTBM. I know u said you dont really want caffiene. Its hard to describe but if youve ever taken a pre-workout and then blown the gym off and gone to bed instead youll know what I mean. You have better options. I usually workout at around 6-7pm and I used to take pre-workout right before which would keep me up all night.</p>

<p>First up the big one. Creatine is in almost every pre-workout for its effects on force production. Gain a significant boost in muscle strength endurance and focus. Dspark is a perfect option and the stuff is only 59 at NTBM. I dont get the jitters or anything like that but the restlessness is the same.</p>

<p>You have better options. 12 medjool dates pitted 12-24 raw almonds. PreMax has no stim effect as far as I can tell and Rag is very mild. I found it difficult to find information on stimulant-free pre-workout and tried dozens. Ive started having myself a cup of coffee at around 3pm now a days and I still have plenty of energy for the workout and can sleep at a normal hour.</p>
