<p>Specifically Primal Surge is designed to deliver heightened energy and endurance increased strength and power laser focus powerful pumps and more muscle gain. The level of pump from Pump Surge is incredible. The taste isnt great but the results will make you forget all about it. PumpSurge is a relatively new product that offers similar benefits but without any stimulants ie. Helios is centered around energy focus and mood.</p>

<p>It supposed to give you great pumps and has excellent reviews. Helios is centered around energy focus and mood. You can be sure to get the same effects of a great pre-workout if not greater without ingesting caffeine. We bought a bottle of the Nitrosurge Pre Workout with stimulants and put it to the test. Quick uptake and an all natural pump based ingredient.</p>
