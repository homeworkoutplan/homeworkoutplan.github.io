<p>Once you are able to work out again its important that you dont get your brows wet for 24 hours after. The salt in sweat will fade. Michelle is currently providing Microblading as a service in our Sugar House location in Salt Lake City Utah. Do not work out the day of the procedure. So I go heavy on the dry shampoo.</p>

<p>It is crucial to avoid sweating during these first two weeks. Any kind of sweat-inducing activity is on the risky side therefore better not experiment for at least the recommended 7 days of the recovery period. Technically you can with extreme caution but I dont trust myself to exercise the necessary level of restraint. For other PRP uses including orthopedic injuries and hair loss the recommendations may be. If you are working out and sweating your sweat will get into the wells we created and try to push the pigment out.</p>

<p>Microblading Recovery Aftercare. Applying Vaseline 3 to 4 times per day during the first week is critical to proper healing. Theyve gone back multiple times for touch-ups and mine are holding up very well even though my skin is much oilier. Will all be trying to get into your microblading wells and push out the pigment reducing your results. Some artists say NO.</p>

<p>This leads to more frequent touch-ups and redos making the whole treatment expensive and rather pointless. Do not use makeup specifically on brows it can fade pigment fast. Do not drink alcohol 24 - 48 hours before your tattoo. When having PRP therapy applied as a topical serum for skin concerns it is likely that your provider will recommend avoiding strenuous physical activity and exercise for about 48 72 hours after treatment. In case you are not you can ask for reshaping your brows.</p>
