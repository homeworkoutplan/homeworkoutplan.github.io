<p>Hell yeah caffeine pills are way easier to take in the morning and they dont stain your teeth. As a general rule avoid caffeine supplements within 6-8 hours of sleeping. Dont take a caffeine pill a few minutes before your workout as it will start kicking in when you are about done lifting. The IOC recommends that it be easy to dose so it is easy to meet that recommendation. If you are planning a high-intensity workout and need the boost taking a pill a half hour or so before your workout should give you a great boost of energy - just remember to not overdo it it is easy to take more than 1 or 2 pills and get caffeine intoxication from too much.</p>

<p>Take this one hour before training or first thing in the morning with a glass of water. The IOC recommends that it be easy to dose so it is easy to meet that recommendation. 20 minutes to an hour before working out works well for me. Also most Caffeine pills have just caffeine and not all the other things you would usually find in your coffee. Most caffeine pills come in doses of 200 mg of caffeine per pill so start with this.</p>
