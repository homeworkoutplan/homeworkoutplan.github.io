<p>As for stretching the jurys still out on whether it can help prevent DOMS but an active cool-down could have some effect. A whole body workout. One study found that people who did a 10-20 minute low-medium intensity cycle after a strength workout reported less muscle pain than those who sat down to rest. Although a day at the spa with a massage therapist is one way to work these knots. These knots will make it hard for you to work out or maintain flexibility.</p>

<p>And I do recommend workouts to strengthen muscles stretches to loosen them and ice to bring blood. When working with a clients with these type of knots I usually work on their trapezius muscles shoulders calves and glutes. This stretches the muscles and increases their blood supply. The best treatment for muscle knots will look different for everyone but a self-massage is a cost-effective safe and convenient place to start. Take time to focus on flexibility and relaxation.</p>

<p>These knots are hard sensitive areas in our muscles that are tight and contracted even when our muscles are at rest. These type of knots can also cause pain in other areas as well. Working out the knots is just a simple language to convey to a client that there is a reason for their pain and it wont go away unless they do something about it. To get rid of muscle knots the advice usually is to foam roll it and see a physio andor chiro. This new hard and lumpy feeling is a muscle knot.</p>
