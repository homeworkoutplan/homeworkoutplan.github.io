<p>By treating Ramadan as an extended deload you can increase your training volume and intensity in the weeks leading up to the month using this time to recover and restore anabolic signalling. During this month many of them fear gaining a ton of fat and wasti. By working certain muscle on different days I can be sure to keep myself ready to go for my next workoutThe worst thing is to feel overly fatigued and sore going into the next days workout so by spacing them out and working different. There isnt a lot of free time during the day during Ramadan so when you workout every minute has to count. The low calorie diet will be sufficient for cutting cardio is uneccessary in my opinion.</p>

<p>The goal of training during Ramadan is strength maintenancegain. When I go to lift especially big weight I look for the best exercises to help get me there. During this month many of them fear gaining a ton of fat and wasti. How can you do that. Five day splits are out even if you are advanced bodybuilder.</p>

<p>Do heavy weights no cardio. Freeze your membership for a month and join a 247 gym during Ramadan. If thats your first meal following a workout you can actually skip the fast-digesting carbohydrates. How should you change your training and nutrition schedule during the month of Ramadan in order to optimise your performance and improve body composition. The fasting duration in Kuwait is 15 hours and this 300 lb muscle machine has 9 hours to train and eat 5000 calories.</p>
