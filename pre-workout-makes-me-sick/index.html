This isnt something that happens every time that I use it but today yesterday and a small handful of times in the past few weeks using this product Cellucor C4 Original Pre Workout Powder Energy Drink w Creatine Nitric Oxide Beta Alanine Fruit Punch 60 Servings. C4 pre-workout mix makes me feel sick lately. Not taking it on an empty stomach. An 1 12 after my preworkout which made me feel nauseous enough not to go to the gym I puked.</p>

<p>Feeling nauseous or sick from working out isnt unusual. Now I just take 14 - 12 scoop whenever I need energy to clean up around the house or study. However not all pre-workout supplements you come across are good for your health. This is either because it isnt diluted enough like with the diarrhea or theres a single ingredient in. Stay hydrated for your workout but dont try to drink a gallon of water right before you hit the gym.</p>

<p>Drink more water with it. Recently Ive been experiencing some dull chest pain and severe restlessness after an intense workout. Take something much MUCH more mild. All of that water in your stomach can make you feel sick and uncomfortable. It only happened when I took it while tired dehydrated or hungry.</p>
