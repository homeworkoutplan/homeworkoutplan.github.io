<p>We have a complete upper lower workout plan for 2 3 4 and 5 day upper lower splits so you can choose the plan that best fits your schedule and level. Use reverse-grip moves and close-grip pullupspulldowns to more strongly emphasize the lower lat area. This shouldnt be your primary row variation but its a great one for adding some heavy volume on. Bent over barbell rows are a somewhat controversial exercise. Basically the pushpullleg-core plan includes chest triceps and shoulder exercises as push workout.</p>
