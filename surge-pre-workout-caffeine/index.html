<p>Of course if you have an underlying health condition especially one of the heart it may be best to take a stimulant-free pre workout or to even just avoid them altogether. ProSupps is a world leader in sports nutrition supplements offering high-quality supplements from pre-workouts protein powders BCAAs and intra and post-workout formulas. The FDA recommends no more than 400mg of caffeine per day so any pre workout powder that has less caffeine than this is generally considered to be safe. Plasm Surge is a non stimulant pre workout which not only increases the energy in your muscles for your workout but also helps facilitate nitric oxide levels which improve blood flow and oxygenation to your muscles. If you are avoiding caffeine many non-stimulant pre-workouts feature ingredients like L-arginine and L-citrulline to fuel muscle pumps. For one Pump Surge earned our editors choice for the no-caffeine formula giving caffeine-sensitive men the ultimate workout without any jitters along the way.</p>
