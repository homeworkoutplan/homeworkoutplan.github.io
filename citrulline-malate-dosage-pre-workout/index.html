<p>Studies indicate that 4-8 grams of citrulline malate is the optimal dosage before a workout 4. Start with this single dose in the beginning and if you feel no effects of this 6 gram citrulline malate dosage shift it to 8-10 grams single dose. Citrulline malate takes about an hour to convert to arginine and then nitric oxide. Using citrulline malate pre-workout will improve overall performance and will allow you to do strenuous activity for a longer period of time. The recommended citrulline malate dosage is 6-10 grams in a day. Successful research studies typically use 6-8 g doses of citrullinecitrulline malate.</p>
<h3 id="8g-would-yield-just-over-45g-of-citrulline-and-approximately-35g-malate">8g would yield just over 45g of citrulline and approximately 35g malate.</h3><p>These phosphates go on to maintain and recycle adenosine triphosphate ATP for muscular contractions. The Citrulline Malate products that I have seen are usually 1-3gserving but I have never taken it as a stand-alone or added it into anything. 3g twice a day is an appropriate dose of citrulline malate to add to your training plan. Unlike other pre-workout supplements that under-dose their ingredients Swolverines L-Citrulline powder offers 5g per serving with 100 unflavored servings per bottle. It will release the health properties of the supplement to benefit your muscles and your overall performance. 8g would yield just over 45g of citrulline and approximately 35g malate.</p>
