<p>At room temperature the powder attracts watermoisture and holds on. Another reason why pre-workouts can go clumpy or hard is that theyre not used as frequently as protein powders or other supplements. But this isnt always the case. Firstly always keep the silica gel packet buried in your pre-workout container. Silica gel packets prevent the powder from attracting moisture.</p>
