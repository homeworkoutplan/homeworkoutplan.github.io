Muscular contractions cause blood vessels to dilate and blood flow to increase. Lactic acid also plays a key role in getting a maximum pump. Gnarly Pre is more of a pre-workout in the classic sense in that it contains a significant amount of caffeine from green tea leaf 180mg in Pre as well as Beta Alanine to help buffer muscle acidity. The pump is almost drug like and is just as addicting.</p>

<p>Gnarly Pre is more of a pre-workout in the classic sense in that it contains a significant amount of caffeine from green tea leaf 180mg in Pre as well as Beta Alanine to help buffer muscle acidity. Most of you will answer. Pre workouts are a mix of stimulants a nitric oxide booster and usually beta alanine. The inclusion of ingredients such as caffeine and taurine are commonplace in popular pre workout supplements and for good reason. It happens because blood moves into your muscles faster than it can leave causing deep red coloration throughout the area and increasing size temporarily.</p>
