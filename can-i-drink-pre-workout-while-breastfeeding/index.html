<p>If you are second guessing nursing at any point pump and dump and then stay away from that pre-workout. When stimulants are consumed in excess they can lead to pregnancy difficulties. Most pre workouts have caffeine and stimulants in them which probably arent compatible with breastfeeding. If you take a pre-workout and youre within your daily allotted caffeine intake Id ultimately say it okay to continue to breastfeed. Talk to your doctor first but a small 8 oz cup of coffee is usually okay which may help pre-workout.</p>

<p>Vega sport says on the warning label not to take while breastfeeding. As a new mom part of your body works on milk production while the other works on keeping the rest of you functioning normally. If you have concerns please consult a physician. Too much caffeine can encourage low birth weight in your baby and a miscarriage. Look for a complete protein.</p>
