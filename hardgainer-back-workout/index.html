Three exercises designed to keep your triceps guessing Written by Jeff Feliciano and Steve Stiefel April 11 2008 FLEXONLINECOM A bodybuilding bromide is that you should do many different exercises for each body part if you expect complete development. They should stick to big compound lifts and avoid isolation exercises. Train ideally 3-5 times a week to get the best results in mass gain. Using the same weight for months is not going to cause a change in your muscle size.</p>

<p>The Hardgainer Workout Approach. 10-20 minute whole body warmup used before-hand to get the body thoroughly warmed-upuse stationary bike or calisthenics etc. The guidance for building muscle losing fat and improving fitness is the same for men and women. Later as the Squat gets hard try for 3 HUGE breaths sucked through teeth between reps. Remember that anything less than 3 sessions a week is not ideal and will not help much in gaining mass.</p>

<p>Aim to do at least 10 real men and women will do more working sets of 6-to-10 repetitions. For back that might be true but triceps are worked most effectively from three basic angles. The HARDGAINER SOLUTION Workout 3 Sets Reps 1 Incline DB Press 5 5 2a Seated Side Laterals 4 20 2b Straight Arm Pulldowns 4 15-20 2c One Leg Leg Press 4 20 3a Seated Alternate DB Curls 4 5-6 EA 3b Lying Triceps extensions 4 12-15. The classic hardgainer workout is a full body workout done at most twice a week andin some cases once every 4-5 days. The best workout for a hardgainer is one thats short and intense.</p>

<p>Remember that anything less than 3 sessions a week is not ideal and will not help much in gaining mass. Moving from say 70-pound dumbbells to 75-pound ones means a total of 10 pounds but due to the instability of the dumbbells its actually a greater increase than 10 pounds on the barbell bench press. Using the same weight for months is not going to cause a change in your muscle size. That you minimize your cardio to no more than 3 sessions per week of 20-30 minutes. The guidance for building muscle losing fat and improving fitness is the same for men and women.</p>
