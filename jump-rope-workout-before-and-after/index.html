<p>Jump on the midsoles of your feet and land softly. So if you jump rope for 20 minutes which is kind of what it felt I did for 1500 jumps that would equate to around 400 calories burned in each session or 2800 calories per week. Jump on the midsoles of your feet and land softly. Keep your feet close together when jumping. Jump Rope HIIT Workout.</p>

<p>Sometimes I even trained twice a day since the 9-minute template blog makes jumping sessions very easy to complete during my lunch break. Keep your jumping height low ½ to 1 off the ground. 1-minute slow jumping warm-up. 4 sets of 3 minutes resting 3 minutes between sets. The only thing the jump rope will do is help develop your cardiovascular system.</p>
