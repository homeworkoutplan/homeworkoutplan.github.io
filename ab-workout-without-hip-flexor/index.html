<p>Ab Workouts Without Hip Flexors Standing Stretch. Extend your legs straight behind you with your toes curled under. Deactivating hip flexors would more than likely mean you wont be exercising your lower abs as theyre strongly linked. Your legs will act as a weight you counteract with your abs so really flex to stop them reaching the floor. Weighted crunches should not work your hip flexor at all.</p>

<p>The idea here is once again to deactivate your hip flexors by activating in this case your glutes. I have already expresses this problem on the Hive and have received a lot of helo and workoutstretching rotines that i am currently following. Now you should only be contacting the mat with your head and upper backshoulders. Then set up for any crunch exercise but have the band pull on the back of your ankles. Among the very best ways to work your hips is to depend on the balls of your feet and prolong your legs straight up.</p>

<p>Tie a medium or heavy band around something secure. Usually on AB day I rarely feel the abs. Heavy deadlifts woudl work your core and offset hip flexor over-development. If your abs arent firing it wont matter how many crunches you do to try and build your absTo make sure your ab exercises provide you with the greatest be. This clip shows how to deactivate hip flexors when doing crunches.</p>
