NSuns 531 LP is a pure powerlifting workout that allows you to gain exceptional amount of strength in a short amount of time. 415 395 x 5 e1RM 460 395 x 5 was on an axle deadlift bar whereas 415 x 1 was on an Ohio deadlift bar. The routine was developed and popularized by a user on reddits rfitness forum. Key principles carried over from 531 include hitting the main lift of the day for a set of 5 reps a set of 3 reps and then a set of 1 rep as well as the notion of using 90 of an athletes 1RM as a TM or training max and calculating all main lifts as a of the TM.</p>
