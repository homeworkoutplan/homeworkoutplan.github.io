<p>The great thing about taking a pre-workout is that they are fast-acting and have acute benefits. While it doesnt have the same benefits that caffeine does for fasting its still calorie-free and doesnt provoke an insulin response. A basic rule of thumb is to avoid all macro nutrients protein carbs fats during a fast. This basically means you can take them whenever you want before you go to the gym and will see the benefits in that same session. Amino Acids can kick you out of a fasted state but some feel the benefits outweigh this.</p>
