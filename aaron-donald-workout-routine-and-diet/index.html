<p>Donald obviously does a lot more than just this 300-rep workout but this is a good set of exercises to do during this time of isolation and social distancing while gyms are closed. I want the best quality protein I can get so 20g of Whey Protein Isolate in every bottle is huge. Aaron Donald returned to his hometown this week and led a summer workout session with middle school kids at his junior high alma mater. Donald is now back at 270 pounds while maintaining his physique on a 3600-calorie diet. See the results for Aaron donald workout in.</p>
